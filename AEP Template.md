## Motivation
The Motivation is the reason that the proposal is being generated and the problem that the user is attempting to fix, or a feature the user is attempting to introduce. The goal is to provide a template from which users can generate technical AEPs. 

## Introduction
The introduction provides initial insight to the document. This is where you will tell the audience about the feature or solution that is being proposed in the Motivation. For example: this document intends to illuminate the general format that is desired from an Akash Enhancement Proposal Draft for technical changes and improvements. This document covers an in-depth analysis of the challenge, the proposed solution, the potential impact to the existing framework, the budget needed, and the responsibilities/requirements this document presents. This template was based on AEP-31.

## Challenge
The Challenge section can be used to illuminate the reader as to why the proposal you are introducing is a needed feature or design. For example: As a result of the Akash Network’s growing consumer and contributor base, there has been a significant rise in users looking for new ways to enhance the existing infrastructure. As a result, the need for a standardized proposal format has become a necessary implementation to the current Akash Enhancement Proposal (AEP) process. 

## Proposal
In the Proposal section, you will outline how you will go about implementing your solution or feature. Be sure to talk about the history and observation of your problem, the various responsibilities and requirements of the team or individual that will be undertaking this work, and any assumptions you may be making about the existing network structure. For instance: The Akash Network is constantly evolving and introducing new features and necessary changes. In order to make this process easier on those individuals who are looking to contribute to the network and its betterment, this template is being designed. This template is being designed under the assumption that no other template presently exists or is largely used by the community, as I, the template creator, have observed to be true. By implementing this proposal template, we will see a more consistent and reliable format for users to present their ideas and promote understanding within the community. 
 
## Budget
Budget is where you will tackle how you expect to be funded for the work you are doing. Traditionally, this section constitutes a Total Cost, source of funding, and a breakout of how the Total Cost was estimated. A useful tool for developing a budget is the “Milestone”. A good proposal will incorporate 4-6 milestones that can be used to estimate how much work will be done per person between any two periods. Beyond providing a more comprehensive breakdown of how much effort will be required to perform your work, milestones also provide a metric by which the community and Akash administration can track your progress through your efforts. A hypothetical breakout could be formatted as:
This proposal will take approximately 2 hours to draft, .5 hours to format, and 1 hour to review in-depth. At a rate of $17 an hour. The Total Cost of this project is $59.5 to be paid from the Akash Community Pool. 

OR:

| Task / Milestone                               | Hours |
|------------------------------------------------|-------|
| Draft Proposal -2/15/2025                      | 2     |
| Format Proposal Tables and Headers - 2/20/2025 | .5    |
| Review Proposal - 2/22/2025                    | 1     |
| TOTAL COST @ $17/hr                            | $59.5 |

For Budget, the more detail you can provide about how you generated your costs, the easier it will be for the community to understand what they are paying for. 


## Framework / Market Impact 
In the Framework / Market Impact section, you will assess how your proposal and your implemented solutions and features will impact the larger Akash Network. This is a vitally important step of the proposal process, you must understand how introducing new features could affect existing framework, especially if it will make an existing feature obsolete or ineffective. For example: This proposal template will invalidate any existing Technical Proposal Templates. The community has accepted this phasing out of old templates, considering this an update to the existing process. Any funding not consumed by the outlined tasking will be returned to the Community Spend Pool.
